# RAG-Powered-Chatbot-for-News-Websites
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot designed to improve user interaction with news websites. It combines document retrieval with large language model (LLM) generation, enabling the chatbot to deliver accurate and context-aware responses by fetching relevant news articles and generating human-like conversational replies.
